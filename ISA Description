# OpenGPU assembly

v0 - v15  -> 16 64 by 64 bit vector registers
r0 - r15  -> 16 64 scalar registers
a0 - a15  -> 16 12 bit address registers
mb        -> 16 bit memory bank select register

To be able to have a larger ISA than a mere 16 instructions, we use the 'extend' instruction. When used, it executes the next line like an extended instruction instead of an ordinary instruction. So you don't go insane programming in OpenGPU ASM, the assembler adds extends for you.
